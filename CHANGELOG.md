# Version 0.1 - 2014-11-02
* I haven't got a clue about version numbering (or where it's appropriate to create a big 'jump'), so 0.1 as a first release seems appropriate. (I'd thought of 0.000001 due to the overall crapness of my first major Github thing, but given the remote chance of collaboration that'd be silly.)
