# Version 0.2 - 2014-11-04
* Hopefully increased the likelihood that the menu will show up for work - by adding `#!/bin/bash` at line 1 of `ayadn_shell.sh`.
* If the menu still fails it might be useful to know that I currently run all (Ubuntu) Terminal window profiles with 'Run command as a login shell' active.
* Thanks @ericdke for the help and @hutattedonmyarm for breaking stuff!


# Version 0.1 - 2014-11-02
* I haven't got a clue about version numbering (or where it's appropriate to create a big 'jump'), so 0.1 as a first release seems appropriate. (I'd thought of 0.000001 due to the overall crapness of my first major Github thing, but given the remote chance of collaboration that'd be silly.)
