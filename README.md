**This is NOT a clone of Ayadn.** I'm messing about with stuff *related* to Ayadn - the App.net command line client by @ericdke. That's all.

If you want see the thing itself, go to the excellent https://github.com/ericdke/na pages.

## Want to know more or try this out?

Please take a look at [my Wiki.](https://github.com/bazbt3/ayadn_shell/wiki)

## Disclaimer:

It might appear as if I know what I'm doing. Maybe yes, maybe no. (I blogged about the first couple of sessions [trying to install Ayadn.](http://bazbt3.re-app.net/2014/10/23/command-line/))
