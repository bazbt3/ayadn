# ~/.tmuxinator/ayadn.yml

# A Tmuxinator layout for the Ayadn App.net command line client

# Prerequisites:
# 1. Ruby and Tmux and Tmuxinator must be installed. It's non-trivial but brings its own, peculiar, rewards.
# 2. An understanding that I'm new to Linux - I'm pretty sure this code won't break anything but be careful if you wish to modify it.
# 3. An understanding that, because I'm new to Linux I've created about 13 documents thus far. All in ~/Documents - easy.
