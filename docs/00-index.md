# The ayadn_shell Documentation

## What this is:

A Linux Terminal window command line menu for Ayadn - a command line client for the App.net social network.

Ayadn was created by [@ericdke](https://github.com/ericdke) and is in very active development. You can find more here: <https://github.com/ericdke/na>.

Has to be said: This menu system is arguably superfluous as a layer above a command line client. A menu though may be attractive to new, otherwise dubious users, whereas a command line could appear 'scary.'

The best thing about the ayadn_shell menu system is this: There's nothing to stop a user dropping out to the command line at any time - whilst the menu is still running.
