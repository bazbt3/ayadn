# What's needed to get this thing to run?

## Prerequisites:
(Where not already installed.)

1. Linux (in my case, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS),
2. cURL (in response to RVM's failure-to-install),
3. Ruby & Rubygems - in my case installed using [RBENV](http://rbenv.org/) (after both the system Ruby *and* RVM's version failed to allow Ayadn to run.)
4. [libevent](http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/),
5. [ncurses](http://invisible-island.net/ncurses/),
6. [Tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/) (the preceding 2 are necessary for this to work),
7. [Tmuxinator](https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator) - `gem install tmuxinator`,
8. [Ayadn](https://github.com/ericdke/na) - `gem install ayadn`.

Some of the steps above were undertaken as a direct result of reading the messages following failures-to-install - and actioned at the command line. Apologies for the sketchiness of these instructions, @ericdke's help installing Ayadn was invaluable for this Linux novice.

## Next steps:

1. Copy the `ayadn.yml` file contents from here, creating a new `~/.tmuxinator/ayadn.yml` file.

2. Copy the `ayadn_shell.sh` from here, creating a new `~/Documents/ayadn_shell.sh` - noting that it must be able to be executed (see the file's properties and change permissions to 'allow executing file as program'.)

3. Copy the `ayadn_run.sh` from here, creating a new `~/Documents/ayadn_run.sh` - noting that it must be able to be executed (as with `ayadn_shell.sh` above.)

  If the menu fails to run it might be useful to know I currently run all Terminal window profiles with 'Run command as a login shell' active.

4. If you haven't previously used Ayadn, type `ayadn help authorize` to see what's necessary to authorise the app to authenticate and interact with the App.net servers. At the very least this will check that Ayadn is installed correctly.

**Important** - `~/Documents` is used throughout these files above simply because I'm very new to Linux, consequently have few *actual* documents on my test system. There will be a more elegant method but I'd rather get things moving before making things pretty.

**Even more important** - I've used bazbt3 (my App.net username) within `ayadn.yml`. Though your account will authenticate you, you might not want to see, e.g. my mentions in your timelines! **Please replace my username with your own!**

## To run Ayadn using the menu system:

1. Open a Terminal window - best made fullscreen and with a fairly small font size.   
   (Otherwise the display won't be created to match my 'vision.')
2. Type `$ cd ~/Documents`
3. Type `$ ./ayadn_run.sh` to start the wonder off.   
  (Linux novices: don't type the `$` - it's the end of the 'prompt'.)
